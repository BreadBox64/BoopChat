## About BoopChat

BoopChat began as a solution to boredom. My friend was over, we had nothing to do, so we started experimenting with the network library in Processing java, and, well, here we are.

The guiding principles of BoopChat are very simple. We wanted to communicate in a nerdy way, and this approach fits the bill quite well. I personally wanted to use our creation as a way to teach young programmers the "imagine it, create it, share it" mindset that I've always had.
